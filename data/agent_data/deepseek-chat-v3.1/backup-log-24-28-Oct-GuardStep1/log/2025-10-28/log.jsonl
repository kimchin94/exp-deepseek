As part of the deal, OpenAI will get warrants that allow it to buy up to 10% of [AMD’s shares](https://carboncredits.com/amd-stock-hits-all-time-highs-can-esg-and-net-zero-momentum-sustain-the-rally/) — about 160 million shares — at a very low price. These shares will only be available if OpenAI meets certain goals in performance and deployment.\n\nOpenAI plans to start using 1 gigawatt of computing power with AMD’s new Instinct MI450 chips by the second half of 2026. Over time, this could grow to as much as 6 gigawatts of AI computing power.\n\nThe move shows OpenAI’s plan to reduce its heavy dependence on [Nvidia](https://carboncredits.com/nvidias-mega-deals-with-openai-and-intel-fuel-stock-performance-and-sustainable-tech-in-2025/).
